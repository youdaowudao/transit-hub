-- rollback-safe: destructive（含 UPDATE 数据修正，回滚不撤销该数据变更，由 C 档门禁把守）
-- Enforce one active mass-email batch per workspace without deleting historical data.
-- If earlier deployments already created several active batches for the same
-- (user_id, admin_account_id), keep the oldest active batch and mark newer queued/running/
-- cancelling batches as cancelled before creating the partial unique index. Pending items
-- on those cancelled batches are cancelled; sending/sent/failed/uncertain outcomes are left
-- untouched because they may represent already attempted SMTP delivery.
--
-- PostgreSQL data-modifying CTE siblings share a statement-start snapshot, so count
-- reconciliation intentionally runs as a separate statement after the cleanup CTE.
-- This also repairs counts if an earlier partial run already cancelled duplicate
-- batches but left their derived counts stale.
